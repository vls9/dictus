# Dictus: a custom dictionary

## Overview

Dictus is a custom dictionary for language learners. With this app, you can record meanings and pronunciations of headwords in structured form.

Unlike with spreadsheets, you can easily record synonymsâ€”you can link many headwords to many meanings, and one headword to many pronunciations.

Dictus is based on Ben Awad's [LiReddit project](https://github.com/benawad/lireddit://). (See his fullstack tutorial [here](https://youtu.be/I6ypD7qv3Z8://).)

## Features

Features of Dictus:

- Add custom meanings and pronunciations
- Add many meanings or pronunciations at once (from one field)
- Add image links to meanings
- Look up and add pronunciations from Wiktionary (in development)
- Link headwords to meanings (many to many) and pronunciations (one to many)

and more!

Note: looking up and adding meanings from Wiktionary is being tested.
