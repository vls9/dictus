# Dictus: a custom dictionary

## Overview

Dictus is a custom dictionary for language learners. With this app, you can record meanings and pronunciations of headwords in structured form.

Unlike with spreadsheets, you can easily record synonymsâ€”you can link many headwords to many meanings, and one headword to many pronunciations.

Dictus is based on Ben Awad's [LiReddit project](https://github.com/benawad/lireddit). (See his fullstack tutorial [here](https://youtu.be/I6ypD7qv3Z8).)

Note: a live website is coming soon!

## Features

*Note: a major update is coming! In the upcoming update, Dictus will adopt Wiktionary structure: many new record fields, headword forms, translations, categories, and much more!*
