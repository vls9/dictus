# Dictus: a custom dictionary

## Overview

Dictus is a custom dictionary for language learners. With this app, you can record meanings and pronunciations of headwords in structured form.

Unlike with spreadsheets, you can easily record synonyms—you can link many headwords to many meanings, and one headword to many pronunciations.

Dictus is based on Ben Awad's [LiReddit project](https://github.com/benawad/lireddit). (See his fullstack tutorial [here](https://youtu.be/I6ypD7qv3Z8).)
